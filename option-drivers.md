###Drivers
for **newer AMD/Nvidia drivers**, 
* via software-sources [see screen-shot](http://i.imgur.com/8FOYNam.png) 'add ppa' option, add `ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa` and __update the cache__
* the newer drivers for amd/nvidia should then be available via Driver-Manager.
* if you have 100% intel graphics or want/need to use opensource drivers, via `terminal` execute `sudo apt update & sudo aptitude upgrade` in order to bring graphics to most current available.
