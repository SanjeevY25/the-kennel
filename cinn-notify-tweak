[06:58] <Two_Dogs> i want notifications@cinnamon.org to keep buffer in last-seen first on list, presently the list is first-seen first on list, i looked at the script, i cant make sense of it, there is a remarks statement indicating the code section, but that is about it? where should i ask? 

[07:04] <mtwebster> Two_Dogs: you can try editing the notification applet, after around line 52 (this._notificationbin = new...)  add this._notificationbin.set_pack_start(true)

[07:04] <mtwebster> no guarantee, haven't tested

[07:05] <Two_Dogs> mtwebster: i will try thanks

[07:16] <Two_Dogs> mtwebster: works beautifully on osuse TW , cinnamon factory repo, thank you

chunk of /usr/share/cinnamon/applets/notifications@cinnamon.org/notifications@cinnamon.org after tweak;
        // Setup the notification container.
        this._maincontainer = new St.BoxLayout({name: 'traycontainer', vertical: true});
        this._notificationbin = new St.BoxLayout({vertical:true});
	this._notificationbin.set_pack_start(true);
        this.button_label_box = new St.BoxLayout();
        
  works great so far, on
